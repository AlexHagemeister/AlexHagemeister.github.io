title: "A Test Post with All the Trimmings"

description: "A kitchen-sink post to test headings, lists, code blocks, links, blockquotes, and other markdown features against the site's styling."
---

This post exists to stress-test the blog layout. Every markdown element that might show up in a real post is included here so you can see how it renders against the site's typography and color scheme.

## Headings and Paragraphs

Regular body text should feel comfortable to read — light weight, muted color, generous line height. Paragraphs have breathing room between them. **Bold text** pops against the muted background, and *italics* add emphasis without shouting.

Here's a [link to something](https://example.com) to check the accent color and hover state.

## Lists

Unordered list:

- First item in the list
- Second item, slightly longer to see how wrapping behaves when the text extends past a single line on smaller screens
- Third item

Ordered list:

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Code

Inline code looks like `this variable` or `function_name()`.

A fenced code block:

```python
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet someone."""
    return f"Hello, {name}."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(hello("world"))
```

## Blockquotes

> — Alan Kay

## Images and Horizontal Rules

No images in this test post, but the layout supports them with `max-width: 100%` and a small border radius.

---

That horizontal rule above should be a subtle `#1a1a1a` line with generous vertical spacing. If everything on this page looks like it belongs on the rest of the site, the blog is working.
