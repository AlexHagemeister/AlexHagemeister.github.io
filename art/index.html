            <h2>The Temple of Transition, 2011. International Arts Megacrew.</h2>
            <p>The Temple of Transition was 120-ft tall structure consisting of six outer temples surrounding a central temple, connected by intricate wooden bridges, with a design inspired by ancient cathedrals and Hindu temples. Participants left messages, mementos, and offerings symbolizing grief and loss. On the final night, the temple was solemnly and silently burned in a ceremony of collective catharsis. For two weeks, the temple held the world record for the largest temporary wooden structure.</p>

            <h2>Embrace, 2014. The Pier Group.</h2>
            <p>A pair of towering wooden sculptures depicting two human forms in an embrace, complete with mechanical beating hearts, inviting the audience to contemplate the beauty of the human form and the power of connection. The sculptures were over 70 feet tall, each with five floors and spiral staircases up into the heads, where the audience could look out through the eyes upon the desert. The structures were then burned, symbolizing the precious yet precarious nature of relationships.</p>

            <h2>The Mazu Temple, 2015. The Dream Community.</h2>
            <p>A temple inspired by the traditional Chinese temples dedicated to the goddess Mazu, built from intricately carved wooden panels, with a 20 ft diameter lotus flower and eight fire-breathing dragons on top. The interior was filled with ornate sculptures, altars, and offerings, and was designed to be a peaceful and contemplative space for festival-goers to reflect and connect. On the final night the temple was burned, symbolizing the release of negative energy and the renewal of the spirit. A primary contribution of mine was the lotus atop the temple, which proved a far greater technical challenge than anticipated.</p>
