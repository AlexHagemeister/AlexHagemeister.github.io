Portfolio site for me, Alex Hagemeister, EECS at UC Berkeley, graduating May 2026. AI/ML infrastructure, RAG systems, document processing, and the messy work of making AI actually useful in production.

The site covers selected work (published ML research, Berkeley-funded RAG platform, SRI), current projects, and a background section that explains how someone goes from Burning Man pyrotechnics and off-grid infrastructure to kernel ridge regression.

Looking for new grad roles on small teams building AI-powered platforms. Details and contact info on the site.
